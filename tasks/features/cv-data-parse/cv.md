## INTERESTS
I am an engineer by heart. I was building something for as long as I can remember. My interest in engineering started with
an old motorcycle and rusty set of tools I found in my father's garage. And now, 30 years later, I am building a smart home
solution using a Cursor and local LLM to make my home more comfortable for me and my family.
I grew up next to the mountains, and I am in love with hikes and reaching mountain peaks. Since a young age I was
organising multi-day hiking's for my friends and family as I wanted to share the beauty of nature and the feeling of connection
with something bigger than your neighborhood.
Snowboarding or Ice climbing, hiking or mountaineering, diving or windsurfing - these are the kinds of questions I ask
myself during my holidays. I am always in search of something new to try. Meeting new people, trying different food,
understanding other cultures are the things that I can't imagine my life without.
I strongly believe that mastering any skill requires the ability to teach it to others. This belief took on new meaning when I
became a father, revealing its true magnitude. My work across diverse environments with colleagues from various cultural
backgrounds has given me experience in connecting with and understanding people - experience whose worth is
immeasurable. I am truly proud I have built efficient and happy teams to work with during my career.

## PAST PROJECTS

### “ChatAgent” (NDA) at Hexaware Jun 2025 - current
Position: Senior Plus FullStack Engineer
Project: The project scope supposed the development of a fully-customisable system composed by client configuration
and intended to integrate AI powered tools on different levels. Agents could read user information and provide
assistance using MCP server and tools. Because of the nature of the product and agnostic design such systems could be
integrated in a variety of environments and be customised on demand.
Tasks performed / Achievements:
Led development of FE application in collaboration with UX/UI designer and provided assistance in solution design and
estimation to production deployment.
Configured client-server communication channel using WebSocket API. Designed and implemented data format and LLM
prompt response to render different chart types.
Configured GitLab deployment pipeline and containerisation flow for QA process.
Technologies:
Web: CRA, React, AgGrid, HeadlessUI, React Testing Library, Jest;
Backend: TypeScript, Python, Node.js, Redis, LangChain, KeyClock, WebSocket API

### Bonfire (NDA) at Hexaware Aug 2024 - May 2025
Position: Frontend Team Lead (60% coding/40% management)
Project: Dating App platform with target to specific audience group. A Web app was built to be configured per brand and use
core flow from a matching engine. Brand managers could configure brand parameters and UI would show a defined set of
features per configuration. The app would also pre-define matching targets and configure core brand settings during user
onboarding process. My goal was to implement a web specific application with details to UX and accessibility in mind and at
same time follow generic design of native app version.
Tasks performed / Achievements:
Configured app monorepo using NX where each app represented a module (onboarding flow, matching flow, account
setting) and could be used separately depending on brand configuration. Project libs consisted of UI library (Components
library), utilities lib (common functionality) and feature libs (feature implementation configured by brand).
Build pre-configuration for unit (Jest) and e2e (Playwright) tests coverage on features and configuration related code. The
UI part was tested using snapshots. Pipeline configured to analyze code with SonarCloud. Assisted team
Implemented pre-commit hooks to maintain feedback loop between QA and Engineering team. Developer MR would trigger
a custom script to check for test-id in new/updated React components and update test-tools library with new/updated id’s.
QA can then use exported id’s per component to build automated tests.
Implemented custom event based system using Axios interceptors to block user flow on defined list of API response
statuses.
Assisted team members during development, MR review and performed ceremonies to follow Scrum framework.
Technologies: TypeScript, React, ReactRouter v7, Axios, Zod, RTL, Playwright, Gitlab DevOps, RestAPI, Scrum

### Notification System (NDA) at Hexaware Jun 2023 - Jun 2024
Position: Frontend Team Lead (70% coding/30% management)
Project: The client is a national level service provider with more than 6000 people working in different departments.
Client main requirements was to have a system to help employees and managers with safety regulations and monitoring
in facilities using AI solutions and modern technologies. The system consisted of Admin Web App (React), BE (Node.js)
and Flutter App for Native platforms. Web app represents a tool for department managers to create/update notification
for specific or a group of employees regarding safety concerns and recommendations. CRM also provided history of
accidents, reports and notifications. Agent flow is used to point out specific requirements from industry regulation by
case basis and help employees to avoid hazard situations.
Tasks performed / Achievements:
My task was to assemble a FE team, onboard each member to the project and provide all necessary documentation and tools
to build an application. We worked with strict deadlines and had very demanding client presentations to show progress and
adjust requirements after review. The AI helper solution was one of such new request upgrades that happened over project
development. The app was built with some future improvements the client had in mind and required careful testing before
rolling out the next version to production.
Was responsible for feature design and worked closely with UI/UX designers and BA to define a new set of tasks for the
upcoming sprint. Paid big attention to application performance to render live status updates of notifications and reports.
Assisted BE team to develop API response schemas following BFF approach and helped with TS implementation on
controllers level. Guided developers to use interface inheritance to reduce the number of complex TS generics.
Was responsible for building and maintaining deployment pipelines using Azure DevOps.
Technologies: React, Node.js, TypeScript, Jest, SCSS, RestAPI, Azure DevOps

### Eriks WebShop at EriksDigital Jan 2021 - Jan 2023
Position: Frontend Team Lead (70% coding/30% management)
Project: Company main product was update and maintenance web solutions for Erik's ecosystem. I was part of the
department responsible for the existing WebShop that was built using the WebSphere ECommerce platform and was
expensive to maintain and complex to upgrade. My team was responsible for the gradual process of transitioning from a
monolithic architecture to a headless front-end using React. Each new feature represented a separate React App injected to
server output HTML on page load. State between the apps was shared by Redux state manager with custom Saga’s function
linked by browser events.
Tasks performed / Achievements:
I started as Senior FE Engineer and assisted the contractor team with the knowledge transfer process. We created
documentation and marked crucial points in ongoing transition to make new team members onboarding as comfortable and
as fast as possible. After full take over I was responsible for assembling FE team and conducted interviews for other company
departments.
Was responsible for re-development of various modules of the WebShop and leading unit test integration process. Some
parts of the app were completely refined as headless solutions provided a much broader spectrum of options compared to the
WebSphere platform. One of the examples is a dynamic navigation panel assembled based on client location since some EU
countries had their own business entity of Eriks (Eriks France, Eriks Belgium, etc.) .
Improved Web shop performance and CEO to comply with Google LightHouse requirements for e-commerce websites and to
stay within top positions for the search engine.
Improved translation flow to automate missing keys generation and automatic translation for missing values. Custom
translation tool was replaced with Localise. Missing translations were highlighted on UI in test and dev environments.
Technologies: React, Typescript, Redux, Redux Saga, StyledComponents, CSS, RestAPI, JSP , MySQL, Localise

### A-Dam WebShop at A-Dam Jan 2020 - Jan 2021
Position: Senior Frontend Engineer
Project: An e-commerce web-shop SPA targeted at enhancing sales for a small Amsterdam-based company. The initial
objective was to expand the client base, which eventually led to the development of a comprehensive system integrating
web-shop, warehouse management, and tax reporting tools. With offline sales discontinued, the focus shifted towards
improving the online experience, resulting in increased market share in the US and China.
Tasks performed / Achievements:
Together with one more colleague we built and shipped the first version of the web-shop increasing yearly revenue by over
then 100%. To move forward with new features, the current open source e-commerce platform we used (Saleor .io) needed
new integrations to be added. This improvement was added to the platform fork and later was sold to the platform owners in
exchange for free lifetime support.
My initial task was to develop user flow to buy products using three clicks from social media advertisements. After flow
implementation we completed transition from React to Next.js to improve UX and initial page render time.
Completed additional fork of the app specifically developed for B2B clients with options to buy bulk amount of products and
pre-order features.
Developed complex Apollo wrappers to manage application caching and reduce load time. After transition to SSR some
functionality was obsolete but helped to understand cache bottlenecks we faced during the Sale period (BlackFriday event for
example).
Technologies: React, Next.js, Python, Typescript, Apollo, GraphQL, CSS, RestAPI, Redis
