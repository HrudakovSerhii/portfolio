# Phase 4: SCSS Styling

## Overview
Implement modular SCSS architecture with mobile-first responsive design, optimized for fast loading and maintainability.

## Subtasks

### 4.1 Setup Variables & Mixins
- [ ] Create SCSS variables for colors (primary, secondary, text, background)
- [ ] Define typography variables (font families, sizes, line heights)
- [ ] Set up spacing variables (margins, padding, breakpoints)
- [ ] Create utility mixins for common patterns (flexbox, positioning)
- [ ] Define animation variables and mixins

### 4.2 Implement Typography System
- [ ] Set up font loading strategy (system fonts for performance)
- [ ] Create typography scale with consistent sizing
- [ ] Define heading styles (h1-h6) with proper hierarchy
- [ ] Style body text and paragraph elements
- [ ] Create text utility classes (text alignment, weight, color)

### 4.3 Build Layout Components
- [ ] Create container and wrapper components
- [ ] Build navigation component styles
- [ ] Design header/hero section layout
- [ ] Create footer component styles
- [ ] Implement section spacing system

### 4.4 Create Responsive Grid System
- [ ] Set up mobile-first breakpoint system
- [ ] Create flexible grid utility classes

- [ ] Prepare for CSS minification in build process

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Modular SCSS architecture implemented
- [ ] Mobile-first responsive design working
- [ ] Typography system consistent across all elements
- [ ] Component library reusable and maintainable
- [ ] CSS optimized for performance
- [ ] All sections styled and responsive

## Notes
- Focus on performance with minimal CSS output
