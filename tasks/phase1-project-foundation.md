# Phase 1: Project Foundation

## Overview
Establish the foundational structure and development environment for a fast-loading static portfolio website using vanilla JS, HTML, and SCSS.

## Subtasks

### 1.1 Setup Development Environment
- [ ] Install Node.js and npm for package management
- [ ] Install Git for version control
- [ ] Install a code editor (VS Code recommended) with relevant extensions
- [ ] Install Live Server extension or similar for local development
- [ ] Set up browser developer tools familiarity

### 1.2 Create Project Structure
- [ ] Create root project directory
- [ ] Set up basic folder structure:
  - `/src` - Source files
  - `/src/pages` - HTML pages
  - `/src/styles` - SCSS files
  - `/src/scripts` - JavaScript files
  - `/src/assets` - Images and other assets
  - `/src/translations` - Translation JSON files
  - `/dist` - Build output directory
  - `/tasks` - Project documentation
- [ ] Create initial HTML entry point (index.html)
- [ ] Create main SCSS file (styles.scss)
- [ ] Create main JavaScript file (app.js)

### 1.3 Initialize Version Control
- [ ] Initialize Git repository
- [ ] Create .gitignore file with appropriate entries for static website
- [ ] Create initial commit with project structure
- [ ] Set up GitHub repository for the project

### 1.4 Configure SCSS Compilation
- [ ] Install SCSS compiler (sass via npm)
- [ ] Create package.json with build scripts
- [ ] Set up build script for SCSS to CSS compilation
- [ ] Configure watch mode for development
- [ ] Create build script for production (minification)

### 1.5 Create Development Workflow
- [ ] Set up local development server configuration
- [ ] Create npm scripts for common tasks (build, watch, serve)
- [ ] Test SCSS compilation pipeline
- [ ] Verify file structure and build process

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Project structure is clean and organized
- [ ] SCSS compilation works correctly
- [ ] Local development server can serve the site
- [ ] Git repository is initialized and connected to GitHub
- [ ] All necessary tools are installed and configured

## Notes
- Focus on lightweight setup since this is a static site
- Ensure build process is simple and fast
- Prepare for modular architecture with separate concerns
