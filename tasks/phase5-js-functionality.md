- [ ] Optimize for Core Web Vitals (LCP, CLS)
- [ ] Create reusable lazy loading utility

### 5.4 Implement Scroll Interactions
- [ ] Add scroll-based animations and reveals
- [ ] Create parallax effects for performance

- [ ] Optimize DOM manipulation and queries
- [ ] Implement debouncing for performance-critical functions

### 5.9 Build Utility Modules
- [ ] Create DOM manipulation utilities
- [ ] Build AJAX utility for form submissions
- [ ] Implement localStorage wrapper utilities
- [ ] Add date/time formatting utilities
- [ ] Create responsive breakpoint detection

### 5.10 Ensure Progressive Enhancement
- [ ] Test functionality with JavaScript disabled
- [ ] Implement graceful degradation
- [ ] Add loading states for dynamic content
- [ ] Ensure core functionality works without JavaScript
- [ ] Create accessibility fallbacks

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Translation system working with multiple languages
- [ ] Navigation fully functional with smooth scrolling
- [ ] Images lazy load efficiently
- [ ] All forms validate properly
- [ ] Animations enhance UX without hurting performance
