# Integration Examples Rule

## Core Principle
Do not create integration examples, demo files, or usage examples unless explicitly requested by the user.

## Guidelines
- Focus on core functionality implementation only
- Provide minimal, focused code that solves the specific requirement
- Avoid creating test files, demo pages, or integration examples automatically
- Save tokens by not generating verbose usage documentation
- Only create examples when user specifically asks for them

## Exceptions
- User explicitly requests "create an example" or "show me how to use this"
- User asks for test files or demo implementations
- User requests integration documentation

## Token Optimization
- Keep responses focused on the essential code
- Avoid lengthy explanations unless requested
- Prioritize working implementation over comprehensive examples
